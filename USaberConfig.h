/*
 * USaberConfig.h
 *
 *  This file is to be included in certain "heavy weight" features of the
 *  Universal Saber library so that they can be optionally excluded from the
 *  build. The code in certain files is #ifdef wrapped such that they contain
 *  no code or only "Light Weight" code unless their corresponding BUILD_XXX
 *  #define exists.
 *
 *  To remove a feature and prevent it from building, simply comment out the
 *  corresponding #define for the feature.
 *
 *  The reason this is necessary is that some of the libraries introduce
 *  declarations that allocate static or global memory or inflate the compiled
 *  hex file size regardless of if the feature is actually used. Not only is
 *  this is an unnecessary waste of resources, it may also introduce
 *  incompatibility with certain MCUs such as the ATTiny chips which don't
 *  support I2C or Wire.
 *
 *	Note that features that do not perform these kinds of "Heavy" actions are
 *	always included as they cost little or nothing in the way of RAM or
 *	compiled hex file size unless they are actually used.
 *
 *	For now, all features are enabled by default.
